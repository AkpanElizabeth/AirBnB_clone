This project is an AirBnB clone project and focuses on building a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. The command interpreter allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, as well as perform various operations on them.

Getting Started

To start the console, simply run the console.py script. This will launch the command-line interface, where you can interact with the AirBnB objects.

Commands

The console supports the following commands:

quit or EOF: Exit the program.

help: Display help information about the available commands.

create: Create a new instance of a specified class and save it.

show: Print the string representation of an instance based on the class name and ID.

destroy: Delete an instance based on the class name and ID.

all: Print all string representations of instances or all instances of a specified class.

update: Update an instance based on the class name and ID by adding or updating attributes.
